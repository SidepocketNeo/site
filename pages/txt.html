		<p><h1><center>DEFCON 201 -- OPEN TECHNOLOGY WORKGROUP</h1></center></p>
<p>The DEFCON 201 (or DC201) Group is a gathering point for folks interested in the alternate applications of science, technology, and other areas of information security; referred to properly as 'hacking'.</p>
<p>Our mission is to help people learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker culture and it's members in the general New Jersey area. We facillitate this through project collaborations, group gatherings, and group activities that will best serve our community and the world.</p><br>
<p><h3>DEFCON 201 Meets Monthly, Every Third Friday, at the Sub Culture; 250 Newark Av Jersey City, New Jersey.</h3></p><br>
<h2>This month's meetup:</h2><br>
<h3>Friday, February 21st: Hackers Lonely Hearts Club</h3>
<p>Cure your lonelyness by learn Software Defined Radio, hack IoT devices, build a Pi-Hole, share stories of Shmoocon, lockpicking and more!</p>
<h4>Schedule:</h4>
<h5>7:00PM - 7:50PM: Intro: Meet &amp; Greet + GPG Keysigning -- DEFCON 201 Members</h5>

<h5>7:50PM - 8:00PM: Talk: Why Pick Up “Artists” Are A Scam; A Social Engineer’s Perspective -- Sidepocket</h5>
<p>In this talk, our speaker with disect various Pick Up Artist techniques and demonstrate why these techinques do not work, the pyschological damage they cause, the bizzaro culture around this study and who it’s actually designed to social engineer. This talk will be prefaced by a TRIGGER WARNING as topics such as sexual harassment and stalking will be touched upon.</p>
	<h5>8:00PM - 8:45PM: An Introduction to Iot Pentetration Testing -- libertyunix</h5>
<p>In this talk we will explore the basic principles of IoT PenTesting, how to build an effective toolset, reverse engineering, and analyzing wireless signals with software defined radio.</p>
<h5>8:45PM - 9:55PM: Workshops: November 2018 -- Open Participation</h5>

<h5>9:55PM - 10:00PM: Wrap-Up: Official end of meeting -- Good night!</h5><br>
<h3>.::LIGHTNING TALKS::.</h3>
<h4>Why Pick Up “Artists” Are A Scam: A Social Engineer’s Perspective</h4>
<p>:..>Like how Scientology has no actual Science or Scientific Method in it, Pick Up “Artistry” projects itself to be Social Engineering backed by Evolutionary Psychology…but it’s not. The crazy part is, there is some social engineering involved but NOT in the way you would think. In this talk, our speaker with disect various Pick Up Artist techniques including popular PUA online portals at the books “The Game” by Neil Strauss and “The Mystery Method” from PUA “master” Erik Von Markovik aka Mystery. This will demonstrate why these techinques do not work, the pyschological damage they cause, the bizzaro culture around this study and who it’s actually designed to social engineer. This talk will be prefaced by a TRIGGER WARNING as topics such as sexual harassment and stalking will be touched upon.</p>
<p>:..>Bio: A Co-Founder of DEFCON 201, an open group for hacker workshop projects in North East New Jersey, Sidepocket is constantly wanting to help people to get better at whatever they want to do and learn. He also has a history with NYC 2600, Radio Statler at Hackers on Planet Earth, Phone Losers of America, Museum of Urban Reclaim Spaces and The Yes Men. Find out more about DEFCON 201 at: http://www.defcon201.org</p>
<h4>An Introduction to IoT Penetration Testing</h4>
<p>:..>IoT devices are one of the biggest challenges for security professionals now and will continue to be in the future. The security of these devices is critical as more of these insecure devices come to market. As security professionals we need to have an idea how these devices effect our organization. In this talk we will explore the basic principles of IoT PenTesting, how to build an effective toolset, reverse engineering, and analyzing wireless signals with software defined radio.</p>
<p>:.>Bio: With 10+ years’ experience in Information Technology, Libertyunix has held positions in the field such as Red Team Analyst, Security Systems Specialist, and Red Team Penetration Tester. Libertyunix has extensive experience in offensive security techniques and defensive strategies. He is currently a professor at Drexel University researching cyber and information security. His research has explored topics such as digital forensics, red team penetration testing, deep learning, IoT, and software defined radio. His graduate research thesis demonstrated the effects physical security systems can play in penetration testing and security assessments. Outside of the zeros and ones Libertyunix is the coach of the USA Roller Sports Women’s Inline Hockey team winning the last 3 world championships.</p>
<h3>.::OPEN PROJECTS::.</h3>
<h4>Practicing Lockpicking & Locksport</h4>
<p>:..>DEFCON 201 will have padlocks and professional practice tumblers provided by TOOOL to practice on. Fun and easy to learn for all ages and backgrounds with two expert instructors!</p>
<h4></h3>PWNagotchi & Wall Of Sheep</h4>
<p>:..>Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based “AI” powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. We will be creating our own DEFCON 201 variant that will be part of a bigger project and need all hands on tech for its birth!</p>
<p>:..>What To Bring: A background in Javascript and Rasberry Pi 3 experience. If you can, bring your laptop with a GitHub account so we can collaborate. If anyone has a 3D Printer, PLEASE BRING IT! We will get you free food and booze!</p>
<h4></h3>Pi-Hole Installation</h4>
<p>:..>Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole (and optionally a DHCP server), intended for use on a private network. Pi-hole has the ability to block traditional website advertisements as well as advertisements in unconventional places, such as smart TVs and mobile operating system advertisements. We are going to install a Rasberry Pi running Pi-hole to the wireless network router at Sub Culture in a first of many hardenings to the venue’s cybersecurity.</p>
<p>:..>What To Bring: A background in either Rasberry Pi (such as NOOBS/Raspbian OS installation) and/or physical network cabling will be helpful but not required. Network configuriation and routing hacking will also be a plus.</p>
<h4>DEFCON 201 VIDEO FILMING</h4>
<p>:..>DEFCON 201 will expand into video media in late September. We will be launching various videos including an Introduction, Member Spotlights, Archived Lightning Talks, Tutorials, Directions and more on the DTube, Vimeo and YouTube Mirror platforms. We will also have downloadable copies on the DEFCON 201 NextCloud of select media for DEFCON 201 Members who want hard copies of videos. If you want to be in the Introduction, Member Spotlights or Archive Lighting Talks you can inquire into us about signing our DEFCON 201 Consent Forums and we will walk you through the process. Those who have not signed our DEFCON 201 Consent Forums during meetings will NOT be recorded in Video or Audio as per our policy. Furthermore, any instances of media recording photo/video/audio via DEFCON 201 Staff will be alerted to all president attendees beforehand prior to recording.</p><br>
