<h3>Whealth &amp; Co. Cafe</h3>
<h4>Journal Square, Jersey City</h4>

<p>Centered right at the heart of Journal Square by the PATH station, with mobile accessibility, coffee and food, inside and outside areas and a passion for the hacker community, we invite everyone to join us in welcoming our new venue and breaking in the house (but not breaking the house). Plus, our venue is allowing us to BYOB so continue that tradition!</p>
